Application
=============
The application is build using Django and React. This results in a 3 tier architecture: client, server(API) and DB.
This  architecture give us the flexibility to scale the different parts of the application when the need arises.

You can find a sequence diagram (here)[https://swimlanes.io/d/J4bU0V4Dj] with more details as to the workflow of the
application

Running the Application
=======================
This is a dockerized application. Use the make command as follows

To build the image

`make setup`

To run the tests

`make test`

To run the application

`make server`

Once you have run the application visit http://localhost:8005 to see the app

Assumptions
==============
- The app only needs to server at most 5req/sec
- The app is running on a single node
- You have docker already installed locally
